# OOP

#### JavaScript and TypeScript Implementation of OOP Concepts

- **Abstraction** - A process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users.
- **Inheritance** - The mechanism by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (properties and methods) of another class.
- **Polymorphism** - The ability of a function to behave differently based on the input. Polymorphism means many forms. There are two types of polymorphism in JavaScript: static (overloading) and dynamic (overriding).
- **Encapsulation** - Allows controlling access to the object. It is a way to restrict access to some of an object's components outside the unit.

#### The Structure

The **ECMAScript5** and **ECMAScript6** directories contain subdirectories. You need to open the `.html` files situated in those folders in a browser. Open the console to see the results.

For running **TypeScript** code, navigate to the `TypeScript` directory and type `tsc` in the terminal. You need to have TypeScript installed globally.

A corresponding `dist` folder will appear according to the `tsconfig.json` configuration, which will contain all compiled `.ts` files. These JavaScript files can be used by the browser. Open the destination path in the browser to see the results.
